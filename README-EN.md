# Rental Management System
Dak Guesthouse Management System is a comprehensive and powerful property management system designed for various stakeholders including tenants, landlords, housekeepers, administrators, and property managers. It is suitable for businesses operating in property management, long-term rentals, short-term rentals, and other accommodation models.
The frontend of the backend management system is built using iview UI framework, while the tenant, landlord, and housekeeper interfaces are developed using uniapp. This allows for cross-platform development and deployment, enabling the system to run on multiple platforms such as WeChat, TikTok, and Alipay Mini Programs, as well as standalone H5 applications. Additionally, it can be packaged as Android and iOS apps. The backend is built using thinkphp6.0.
